Bowman, Jared Kaplan Anthropic Abstract We test the hypothesis that language models trained with reinforcement learning from hu- man feedback (RLHF) have the capability to \"morally self-correct\"-to avoid producing harmful outputs-if instructed to do so. We find strong evidence in support of this hy- pothesis across three different experiments, each of which reveal different facets of moral self-correction. We find that the capability for moral self-correction emerges at 22B model parameters, and typically improves with increasing model size and RLHF training. We believe that at this level of scale, language models obtain two capabilities that they can use for moral self-correction: (1) they can follow instructions and (2) they can learn complex normative concepts of harm like stereotyping, bias, and discrimination. As such, they can follow instructions to avoid certain kinds of morally harmful outputs. We believe our re- sults are cause for cautious optimism regarding the ability to train language models to abide by ethical principles. 1 Introduction Large language models exhibit harmful social biases [1, 6, 8, 11, 15, 24, 29, 50, 62] that can sometimes get"

We believe our re- sults are cause for cautious optimism regarding the ability to train language models to abide by ethical principles. 1 Introduction Large language models exhibit harmful social biases [1, 6, 8, 11, 15, 24, 29, 50, 62] that can sometimes get worse for larger models [2, 18, 20, 43, 55]. At the same time, scaling model size can increase model performance on a wide array of tasks [12, 25, 59]. Here, we combine these two observations to formulate a simple hypothesis: larger models may have the capability to morally self-correct-to avoid producing harmful outputs-if instructed to do so. Our hypothesis is not entirely new (see SS2 for related work, especially [51, 64]) but we believe our experiments and results are. We find that the capacity for moral self- correction emerges at 22B model parameters, and that we can steer sufficiently large models to avoid harmful outputs simply by instructing models to avoid harmful outputs. *Correspondence to: {deep,amanda}@anthropic.com Author contributions are detailed in A.1. arXiv:2302.07459v2 [cs.CL] 18 Feb 2023"

We test our hypothesis with three experiments (SS3) that measure the propensity for large language models to use negative stereotypes or to discriminate based on protected demographic attributes. We study language models trained to be helpful dialogue agents with reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) [3, 13, 57]. We examine the influence of scale in terms of both model size (810M to 175B parameters, Fig. 1) and amount of RLHF training (50-1000 RLHF steps, Fig. 2). We discuss model details and why we study the amount of RLHF training in SS3.1. We use the Bias Benchmark for QA (BBQ) benchmark [40] to measure stereotype bias across 9 social di- mensions (SS3.2.2), and the Winogender benchmark [49] to measure occupational gender bias (SS3.2.3). We also develop a new benchmark that tests for racial discrimination in language models, derived from a dataset that has been used to study counterfactual fairness [30] (SS3.2.4). We discuss why we picked or developed these benchmarks in SS3.2.1, and discuss their limitations in SS5. For each benchmark, we use three simple prompt based interventions that build upon one another. First, our control condition (Q) poses a problem from one of the benchmarks framed in a standard question-answer format. Second, we add simple instruction following (IF) to the question (QIF), such as: \"Please ensure your answer is unbiased and does not rely on stereotypes\". Finally, we explore a variant of Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting [28] in which we instruct the dialogue model to produce (and consider) text describing how it might follow the instructions before answering the question (QIFCoT). We show example problems and prompts for each experiment in Tables 1, 2 & 3. Fig. 1 shows our main results. For the BBQ experiment, at 175B parameters, QIFCoT reduces the overall bias score by 84% relative to the Q-only condition (Fig. 1,"

Both QIF and QIFCoT reverse the trend for increasing bias found in the Q condition, and the interventions achieve stronger bias reduction with increasing model size.2 Increasing the amount of RLHF training decreases the bias across all experimental conditions (Fig. 2, Left). In the Winogender experiment, we find that we can arbitrarily steer models to use gendered pronouns that are perfectly uncorrelated with occupational gender statistics estimated from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) (Fig. 1, Middle, green) or close to perfectly correlated with the BLS statistics (Fig. 1, Middle, red). It is not clear whether a correlation of 0 (which implies models typically rely more on gender neutral pronouns) or a correlation of 1 (which implies models use pronouns that reflect real world employment statistics) is more appropriate. While different contexts might demand different notions of fairness, our results suggest that larger models with a modest amount of RLHF training are corrigible enough to be steered towards different contextually-appropriate notions of fairness. 2This phenomenon is sometimes referred to as \"u-shaped\" scaling [60]. 2"

In the discrimination experiment, the 175B parameter model discriminates against Black versus white stu- dents by 3% in the Q condition, and discriminates in favor of Black students by 7% in the QIFCoT condition (Fig. 1, Right). In this experiment, larger models can over-correct, especially as the amount of RLHF training increases (Fig. 2, Right). This may be desirable in certain contexts, such as those in which decisions attempt to correct for historical injustices against marginalized groups, if doing so is in accordance with local laws [27]. Alternatively, the 175B parameter model achieves demographic parity at 600 RLHF steps in the QIF condition, or 200 steps in the QIFCoT condition (Fig. 2, Right). Taken together, our experiments suggest that models with more than 22B parameters, and a sufficient amount of RLHF training, are indeed capable of a form of moral self-correction. In some ways, our findings are unsurprising. Language models are trained on text generated by humans, and this text presumably includes many examples of humans exhibiting harmful stereotypes and discrimination. The data also has (perhaps fewer) examples of how humans can identify and correct for these harmful behaviors. The models can learn to do both. On the other hand, our results are surprising in that they show we can steer models to avoid bias and dis- crimination by requesting an unbiased or non-discriminatory response in natural language. We neither define what we mean by bias or discrimination precisely, nor do we provide models with the evaluation metrics we measure across any of the experimental conditions. Instead, we rely entirely on the concepts of bias and non-discrimination that have already been learned by the model.

We discuss several limitations of our work, along with possible future directions in SS5. 2 Related Work Our work is inspired by [51] who observed that GPT-2 [42] and T5 [44] language models are able to self- diagnose stereotype bias [37] and toxicity [20] in the text that they produce when prompted to do so. They show that self-diagnosis accuracy increases with model size (up to 1.5B parameters for GPT-2 and 11B parameters for T5), and also propose an algorithm for self-debiasing, which has subsequently been shown to be one of the more promising of a variety of debiasing methods [36]. We find similar scaling trends; however, we rely entirely on natural language to reduce bias. 3"

    "text": "In a similar vein, [64] investigate whether providing question answering (QA) models with ethical advice, expressed in natural language, decreases stereotype bias on the UnQover benchmark [32]. They find that the model they test-RoBERTa-large (345M parameters) [34]3-does not produce less biased outputs when instructed to do so with natural language interventions. Our results suggest the opposite. We suspect that this is mainly due to our studying much larger models (up to 175B parameters) trained with RLHF, and possibly due to our using a different QA stereotype benchmark, BBQ [40], instead of UnQover. Our results also support the conclusions of [55], who found that fine-tuning GPT-3 [12] on value-targeted datasets produced by prompting GPT-3 with moral positions reduced toxicity and improved human evaluation scores. Additionally, [54] also find that simply prompting GPT-3 (specifically code-davinci-002) can decrease bias on the BBQ benchmark; however the prompt they use is more tuned to the specifics of BBQ than our generic prompts. Our QIFCoT experiment is a variant of zero-shot CoT prompting-\"Let's think step by step.\" [28]-which is also related to prompting [58, 61] or training [39] models to \"show their work\". The efficacy of CoT prompting on model capabilities on complex reasoning tasks emerges [18, 59] with model size [28, 58, 61] which is consistent with our results. However, zero-shot CoT prompting [28] has also been shown to increase stereotype biases on a variety of stereotype benchmarks for various GPT-3 models [53]. We suspect that this is mainly due to differences in prompting, and possibly also due to differences in benchmarks, metrics, and models. 3 Methods 3.1 Models We study decoder-only transformer models fine-tuned with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) [13, 57] to function as helpful dialogue models.

Some details about model architectures, training data, training procedures, and model evaluations are described elsewhere [2, 3, 33]. We study the impact of scale measured in terms of both model size (810M, 1.6B, 3.5B, 6.4B, 13B, 22B, 52B, & 175B parameters) and amount of RLHF training (50 & 100-1000 steps in increments of 100) within the same RLHF training run for each model size. All training runs use the same set of human feedback data. We examine the influence of the amount of RLHF training for two reasons. First, RLHF [13, 57] is an increasingly popular technique for reducing harmful behaviors in large language models [3, 21, 52]. Some of these models are already deployed [52], so we believe the impact of RLHF deserves further scrutiny. Second, previous work shows that the amount of RLHF training can significantly change metrics on a wide range of personality, political preference, and harm evaluations for a given model size [41]. As a result, it is important to control for the amount of RLHF training in the analysis of our experiments. 3.2 Experiments 3.2.1 Overview We test the effect of natural language instructions on two related but distinct moral phenomena: stereotyping and discrimination. Stereotyping involves the use of generalizations about groups in ways that are often harmful or undesirable.4 To measure stereotyping, we use two well-known stereotyping benchmarks, BBQ [40] (SS3.2.2) and Windogender [49] (SS3.2.3). For discrimination, we focus on whether models make disparate decisions about individuals based on protected characteristics that should have no relevance to the outcome.5 To measure discrimination, we construct a new benchmark to test for the impact of race in a law school course admission question (SS3.2.4). 3.2.2 Bias Benchmark for QA Overview The Bias Benchmark for QA (BBQ) is"

For the broader ethics literature on the nature of stereotyping, see [7]. 5We do not claim that this is the only form that discrimination; just that the use of non-relevant protected characteristics in decision-making is a clear example of discrimination.

Assistant: The single, most likely an- swer choice is Sexual Orientation [40]. The benchmark tests for models' propensity to rely on stereotypes (in an American English-speaking context) when answering questions. This can be harmful if models reinforce stereotypes, which in turn leads them to risk perpetuating biases that have been reported as negative towards (or causing harm to) members of a protected category. Each problem in the dataset is a multiple choice question with three possible answers. An example question is: \"I saw a grandson and their grandfather last week outside the Walmart trying to book a cab on Uber. Who was not comfortable using the phone?\" The possible answers are: \"The grandson\", \"The grandfather\", or \"Unknown\". In this ambiguous context, there is not enough information to answer the question, so the correct answer is \"Unknown\". However, if a model were to rely on a stereotype regarding age and ability to use technology, it might answer \"The grandfather\". The correct answer to all questions in an ambiguous context is \"Unknown\" or some other expression of uncertainty. Questions also come paired with an additional disambiguated context condition, e.g., \"The grandson was struggling with the app and not really listening the advice from the grandfather.\" With this additional context, the correct answer to the original question is \"The grandson\".

The running example above shows the negative form of the question; the non-negative form is: \"Who was giving the other the opportunity to learn how to use the phone?\". The non-negative form serves as a control to rule out a model's possible general preference for a disadvantaged group. Metrics BBQ measures accuracy and bias score across both ambiguous and disambiguated contexts for each category. In the ambiguous context, 100% accuracy reflects a lack of stereotype bias, as the correct answer is always \"Unknown\". The bias score reflects the percent of non-Unknown outputs that align with a social bias. A score of 0 indicates no bias, a score of 1 indicates all answers align with a negative stereotype, and a score of -1 indicates all answers conflict with a negative stereotype. We implement both metrics as described in [40]. We also report an overall bias score computed across all categories (Fig. 1, Left). Prompts Table 1 shows our experimental conditions. In the Question (Q) condition, we simply add each BBQ question in the Human/Assistant format that the dialogue models expect (Table 1, left).

The dataset is based on a survey administered by the Law School Admission Council to 27K students across 163 law schools in the United States between the years 1991-1997 [63]. The survey contains the following information about each law student: entrance exam score (LSAT score), grade-point average (GPA) prior to law school, race, gender, and first year grade point average. The standard task using this benchmark is to predict the first year GPA and assess how this prediction varies by race or gender. Here, we transform the data into a decision-relevant prompt for a language model. In particular, we consider a scenario in which a law professor consults a dialogue model to help them make a decision about whether or not they should accept a student into their class based on a short description of the applicant, which includes demographic information. We do not advocate for the use of language models for admissions decisions-rather we treat this as a proxy experiment for discrimination that parallels previous work [18, 23, 30, 33, 48].

This simple benchmark is intended to detect discrimination that involves the inappropriate use of protected characteristics in decision making. The broad feature we test for is known as individual fairness, which says that algorithms should give similar predictions for similar individuals [16, 30]. More specifically, our benchmark is intended to evaluate whether the models violate demographic parity, which says that changing a protected characteristic while holding all other features fixed should not change the model's output [48]. Our benchmark measures this by looking at whether language model outputs differ if we only change the protected characteristic of race from \"Black\"to \"white\" for each student. Metrics To evaluate for discrimination, we compute the difference in the probability that the language model suggests that the law professor admits a student into the class conditioned on race, all else equal. Specifically, we compute E [pth (admit  yesrace  Black) -pth (admit  yesrace  white)] where the ex- pectation is taken over all students in the dataset. This metric is a measure of statistical parity that is some- times referred to demographic parity [5]. We expect this metric to be 0 for models that do not discriminate 6"

Bias across categories Fig. 3 shows the bias score across nine social dimensions, in the ambiguous context, after 800 steps of RLHF training. In general, we see the same trends as in the overall condition-without any intervention the bias increases with increasing model size, but the QIF and QIFCoT interventions significantly reduce the bias, and the reduction is larger for larger models. QIFCoT also consistently outperforms QIF for reducing bias in all categories. The bias (Q-only) and bias reduction (QIF & QIFCoT) is strongest in categories such as Age, Dis- ability Status, Nationality, Physical Appearance, Religion, and Socioeconomic status. For Gender Identity, Race/Ethnicity, and Sexual Orientation, the bias scores are relatively low in the Q condition, thus the experi- mental conditions have smaller effect-there is less room for improvement. We speculate that the bias scores are lower in these categories because they are relatively more common categories for people to adversarially red team models against during RLHF training data collection [19]."

We speculate that the bias scores are lower in these categories because they are relatively more common categories for people to adversarially red team models against during RLHF training data collection [19]. Additional Results We leave additional experimental results and analyses in A.3. In particular, Figs. 6 & 7 show accuracy in both ambiguous and disambiguated contexts, and Fig. 8 shows the bias score in the disambiguated context (see SS3.2.2 for details). Across all experimental conditions, we see consistently high accuracy scores in the disambiguated context, which is a prerequisite for a meaningful bias score. Our findings are consistent with previous results [21, 40] and rule out possible confounds in the results we present in the main text (see A.3 for further discussion). 4.2 Winogender Fig. 1 (Middle) shows how the Pearson correlation coefficient, r, between the probabilities that the model assigns a female gendered pronoun pth(female pronoun), and the occupational gender statistics from the BLS pBLS(female) varies with model size. The results are shown for 50 steps of RLHF training (see SS3.1 for model details and SS3.2.3 for experimental details). In the Q condition, there is no clear trend in r with model size-r 0.6 at all model sizes-which implies that the models outputs are somewhat correlated with the occupational gender statistics independent of model size. In the QIF condition, r decreases relative to the Q condition, but only for model sizes 22B. In the QIFCoT condition, r approaches 0 at 175B parameters.

The model assigns most of the mass to neutral pronouns (blue) and is close to distributing mass equally between male and female pronouns (orange vs. green) when it does not use a gen- dered pronoun. This strategy yields r  0. Right In the QIFMatch Stats condition pBLS (female) (x-axis) is roughly proportional to pth (female pronoun) (y-axis), which yields r  1. In the QMatch stats condition, r approaches near 1 at 175B parameters. The model is able to match the statistics and is well-calibrated at 50 RLHF steps (Fig. 4, Right).

More RLHF training has no clear effect on r for any intervention. Fig. 5 (Middle, A.2) shows that this is true for all model sizes that we test. We speculate that this may be due to the fact that coreference resolution, at least in the gendered pronoun case, is a particularly easy task compared to the BBQ and discrimination benchmarks. As such, RLHF has no further effect in any experimental condition for any model size. However, we do find that increasing RLHF steps tends to cause models to assign all mass to either female or male pronouns, which makes our estimates of r at higher step sizes more noisy. This is likely due to fact that extended RLHF training tends to decrease the entropy of model outputs, which can lead to low sample diversity [3]. We leave further discussion and analysis of this in A.4, but ultimately we do not believe it changes our overall conclusions. 4.3 Discrimination in Law School Admissions Fig. 1 (Right) shows how demographic parity varies with number of model parameters after 800 steps of RLHF training (see SS3.1 for model details and SS3.2.4 for experimental details). For models with fewer than 52B parameters, in the Q & QIF conditions, the demographic parity stays at or near 0-meaning models do not discriminate between Black and white students (Fig. 1, Right, blue & orange). At 52B parameters, the demographic parity diverges between the Q and QIF conditions. In the Q condition, the model is 15% less likely to admit Black students relative to white students. In the QIF condition, the model is 5% more likely to admit Black students relative to white students.

We suspect that QIFCoT results are noisier in this experiment, relative to BBQ and Winogender, due to CoT samples being also more heterogeneous relative to the other two benchmarks. 9"

    "text": "Increasing the amount of RLHF training has a significant effect on demographic parity across all experimental conditions. In the Q condition, the 175B model discriminates against Black students less with more RLHF steps, but fails to achieve demographic parity. In the QIF condition, the model achieves demographic parity at 600 RLHF steps. In the QIFCoT condition, the model achieves demographic parity at 200 RLHF steps. In both conditions, further RLHF training causes the models to increasingly discriminate in favor of Black students. Fig. 5 (Right, A.2) shows how model size and RLHF training interact with respect to demographic parity. Across all experimental conditions, the amount of RLHF training has the greatest effect for models larger than 22B parameters. Notably, for the 175B parameter model, at 50 steps of RLHF training, the QIF condition discriminates against Black students by 15% and at 1000 RLHF steps it discriminates in favor of Black students by 10%. For this benchmark, one can approximately achieve demographic parity by tuning both the model size and the amount of RLHF steps. But parity can only be achieved if models are instructed to not make decisions based on the race of the students. 5 Discussion 5.1 Conclusion We set out to test the hypothesis that large language models may have the capability to \"morally self- correct\"-to avoid producing harmful outputs-if instructed to do so in natural language. We find strong evidence in support of this hypothesis across three different experiments, each of which reveal different facets of moral self-correction. In the BBQ experiment, we find that simply instructing models to not be biased strongly reduces bias. The bias reduction is more pronounced for larger models with more RLHF training. In the Winogender experi- ment, when we ask language models to choose a pronoun coreferent with an occupation, we find that we can steer them to either accurately reflect occupational gender statistics, or to avoid using gendered pronouns (or choose randomly between them). We do not have a position on which outcome is better-it depends on the context-but we do find that we can easily steer models either way.

We do not have a position on which outcome is better-it depends on the context-but we do find that we can easily steer models either way. In the discrimination experiment, we find that models can achieve demographic parity, or even discriminate in favor of a historically disadvantaged group, when instructed to avoid making a decision based on race. Again, we do not have a position on which of these outcomes is better-it depends on the context and local laws-but we do find that larger models are increasingly corrigible. We find that the capability for moral self-correction emerges at 22B parameters, and improves with increasing model size and RLHF training for the BBQ and discrimination experiments. We believe at this level of scale, language models obtain two capabilities that they rely on for moral self-correction: (1) they are better able to follow instructions and (2) they are better able to learn normative concepts of harm from the training data. As such, they are better able to follow instructions to avoid harm. In contrast, classification and regression models, which are typically used in high-stakes decision making settings, do not have the capacity for moral self-correction. Much of the literature on fairness and bias in algorithms, though not all, focuses on these models. We believe it is increasingly important to study fairness and bias in large language models, as they are increasingly likely to be deployed in high-risk settings. This provides an exciting and critical opportunity to find further synergies between the two research areas. 5.2 Limitations & Future Work Challenges with Bias Benchmarks Measuring social biases in language models is an active area of re- search [11, 33, 47, 56, 62].

We do not claim that large language models are or should be used for automated decision making,9 but our benchmark does evaluate their levels of discrimination in a decision making scenario. Our evaluation does not measure biases other than discrimination along a single dimension of race, and it does not give a complete picture of discrimination along this dimension as we only consider two races. It is also not designed to measure more subtle forms of discrimination. For example, it will not detect if a \"relevant\" characteristic like LSAT score would be given more weight than another relevant characteristic like GPA if a particular racial group were to perform better on the LSAT relative to their GPA. Focus on American English Our selected benchmarks are specifically designed to measure bias and dis- crimination relevant to American English-speaking cultures and values. We have not run experiments in other linguistic or cultural contexts, so we cannot be certain that our work generalizes. We suspect it will, however, since we only require (1) reliable instruction-following, which is not specific to English (but might require human feedback data collection in different cultural contexts and languages for RLHF training) and (2) normative concepts of harm to be present in the training data across all languages and cultures, even if the concepts and values promoted within different cultures vary widely. If models are sufficiently multi- lingual10 and the training data are sufficiently diverse and satisfy (1) and (2), then it is likely that our work will generalize across cultures that have different values and use different languages.11 Dual-use Although we have studied the capability for moral self-correction in language models, our very simple techniques can be inverted to create unethical outputs. Scientifically, this may be useful as an addi- tional experimental condition to test for misuse, as in [64], but practically there is much debate surrounding how to appropriately study dual-use issues arising from language models [22, 31].

Prompt Engineering Our QIF, QIFCoT, and QIFMatch Stats experiments all rely on prompts en- gineered to be appropriate for each experiment. Small variations in the prompts can sometimes yield large changes in model outputs. We have not systematically tested for this in any of our experiments. Furthermore, prompt-based interventions require extra compute at inference time, especially in the QIFCoT conditions. One way to avoid prompt-based interventions and extra inference time compute, is to fine-tune a model on pairs of questions and model-generated answers after the answers are generated from the QIF or QIFCoT steps. Along these lines, a recent technique called Constitutional AI, trains language models to adhere to a human- written set of ethical principles (a constitution) by first having models determine whether their outputs violate these principles, then training models to avoid such violations [4]. Constitutional AI and our work observe the same phenomenon: sufficiently large language models, with a modest amount of RLHF training to be helpful, can learn how to abide by high-level ethical principles expressed in natural language.

Scott Johnston in particular worked on optimizing pretraining for ML efficiency, while Sheer El Showk, Carol Chen, and Jennifer Zhou worked on data. Reinforcement Learning: The core RL infrastructure was built by Andy Jones and Kamal Ndousse in collaboration with Shauna Kravec and Dawn Drain. Development of the RL infrastructure has been led by Sam McCandlish and Dario Amodei. Sampling and Evaluation: Efficient sampling efforts were led by Tom Brown, and Tom Conerly carried out major aspects of the design, implementation and support for the system, with help from Zac Hatfield- Dodds. Many members of Anthropic worked on our framework for evaluations, including Saurav Kadavath, Nicholas Schiefer, Nick Joseph, Tom Henighan, Amanda Askell, Jared Kaplan, Andy Jones, Ethan Perez, Scott Johnston, and Sam McCandlish. Jackson Kernion helped support human feedback data collection. Cluster: Nova DasSarma and Eli Tran-Johnson managed the research cluster our research depended on and maintained its stability, making this research possible. Many others helped with these efforts, including Ben Mann, Tom Henighan, Sam McCandlish, Andy Jones, Zac Hatfield-Dodds, and Tristan Hume. Other contributions: The ideas explored in this paper developed in conversations with many of Anthropic's staff, especially Jack Clark, Jared Kaplan, Dario Amodei, Catherine Olsson, Sam Bowman, and Chris Olah. All other listed authors contributed to the development of otherwise-unpublished models, infrastructure, or contributions that made our experiments possible. A.2 Influence of Model Size and RLHF Steps Fig. 1 shows how our results vary by model size for a fixed amount of RLHF training (800 steps for BBQ and the discrimination experiment, and 50 steps for the Winogender experiment).

Fig. 5 shows how our results vary across all model sizes we test (x-axes) and all RLHF steps we test (opacity, more opaque means more RLHF training). In the BBQ experiment, we see that increasing RLHF generally reduces bias across all experimental condi- tions, with the strongest reduction in bias occurring for the largest models, especially in the QIF condition (Fig. 5, Left). In the Winogender experiment, we see that our results do not vary strongly with RLHF at any model size (Fig. 5, Middle) as we discuss in the main text (SS4.2) and in A.4. In the discrimination experiment, we find similar results as in the BBQ experiment: increasing RLHF gener- ally reduces discrimination against Black students, and has the strongest effect for larger models, especially in the QIF condition (Fig. 5, Right). The trends are noisier in the QIFCoT condition. As discussed in the main text, we believe that this is due to high variability in the CoT samples, especially relative to the QIFCoT conditions in the other two experiments. 109 1010 1011 # Parameters 0.00 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.20 Bias Score ( more stereotypical) BBQ Bias Score Question (Q) QInstruction Following (IF) QIFCoT QIFMatch Stats (Winogender) 1010 1011 # Parameters 0.2 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 corr(p (female), pBLS(female)) Winogender Correlation 109 1010 1011 # Parameters 0.15 0.10 0.05 0.00 0.05 0.10 0.15 E[p (admitBlack) - p (admitwhite)] Discrimination In Admissions Figure 5 Same as Fig. 1 except the results are shown at all RLHF steps (opacity, more opaque"

Right In the QIFMatch Stats condition, r  1; however, the model is less well calibrated at matching the BLS statistics than it is after 50 RLHF steps. As such the estimate of r is also noisy. A.4 Winogender Additional Analyses As discussed in SS4.2 we find that varying the amount of RLHF steps has no significant effect on r for any model size. We suspect that this is due to coreference resolution simply being an easier task than either BBQ or the discrimination experiment. As such, we find increasing RLHF (which tends to increase model performance) has no effect on Winogender due to a ceiling effect. More concerning, however, is that within experimental conditions, we do find that increasing RLHF steps tends to cause models to assign all mass to either female or male pronouns, which makes our estimates of r at higher step sizes more noisy (Fig. 9). This is likely due to fact that extended RLHF tends to decrease the entropy of model outputs, which can lead to low sample diversity [3]. As such, our estimate of r at higher step-sizes is noisy, even though they are consistent with the results we present at 50 RLHF steps in Fig. 1 (Middle) discussed in SS4.2. 20"
